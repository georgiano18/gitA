            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p><strong>NAME:</strong> OSELADE GEORGE OLUWASEUN</p>
            <p><strong>HOMETOWN:</strong> EMURE EKITI, NIGERIA</p>
            <p><strong>STUDENT ID:</strong> ALT/SOE/024/1224</p>
            <p><strong>EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND:</strong> After completing my secondary education in 2017, I gained admission to the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA) in 2018, where I am currently in my final year pursuing a degree in Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This program has equipped me with a solid foundation in spatial data analysis and remote sensing technologies, deepening my passion for using technology to address real-world challenges. Alongside my studies at FUTA, I am also pursuing Cloud Engineering at ALT School, recognizing its importance in today's tech landscape. This dual focus has been challenging yet rewarding, allowing me to develop a diverse skill set that bridges both GIS and Cloud Engineering. As I approach the completion of my degree, I am eager to integrate these disciplines and pursue my goal of becoming a successful DevOps engineer.</p>
            <p><strong>HOBBIES AND INTEREST:</strong> Hobbies and Interests: In my free time, I enjoy playing table tennis. It’s not just a sport for me, but a way to relax and unwind while staying physically active. The fast pace of the game keeps me on my toes, and I love the challenge of improving my skills. Beyond the physical benefits, table tennis helps sharpen my focus and reflexes, making it an activity I always look forward to. It’s a perfect balance of fun and fitness, and it gives me a break from my academic and professional pursuits.</p>
            <p><strong>CAREER GOALS:</strong> My ambition is to become a successful DevOps engineer, driven by my passion for cloud technologies. I chose ALT School’s School of Engineering to gain expertise in Cloud Engineering, where I am currently building the essential skills and knowledge needed to excel in the dynamic field of DevOps.</p>
